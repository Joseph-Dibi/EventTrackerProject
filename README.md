I created a very simple mile tracker that uses restful services. Users can input(Post) how many miles they have run per session. If they make an error they are able to edit (put) or remove(delete) runs. They are also able to view(Get) all of their runs or a specific run. Finally, users can track their average miles or total amount of miles ran.
